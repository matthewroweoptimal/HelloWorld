 * Synopsis : UHIP HostCPU RX Timer Interface
 *
 * This is a polled one-shot timer, that is used for the UHIP protocol RX timeouts.
 * A high timer resolution is not necessary, as long the timer is fairly accurate (+/- 100ms)
 *
 * The implementation of this interface must be provided on the HostCPU platform by the customer.
 *
 * The RX timer is used to recover if COBS synchronisation is every lost on the receive path on the
 * host CPU. 
 * It is used as follows:
 * a) It is started when we receive the initial 0x00 at the start of the COBS encoded UHIP packet
 * b) It is stopped when a full COBS encoded packet is received by the HostCPU. 
 * c) It is reset / restarted every  time a "32-byte chunk" is received. 
 * d) If the timer has fired/expired this means that we have lost COBS synchronisation, and should
 *	  reset our RX buffer
