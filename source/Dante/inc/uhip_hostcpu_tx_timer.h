 * Synopsis : UHIP HostCPU TX Timer Interface
 *
 * This is a polled one-shot timer, that is used for the UHIP protocol TX timeouts.
 * A high timer resolution is not necessary, as long the timer is fairly accurate (+/- 100ms)
 *
 * The implementation of this interface must be provided on the HostCPU platform by the customer.
 *
 * The TX timer is used for two purposes. 
 * 1) To ensure that only a single UHIP data transaction is pending at any time.
 *    When used for this purpose it is controlled as follows:
 *    a) It is started when the HostCPU transmits a non protocl control packet (i.e. a UHIP data packet)
 *    b) It is stopped when a ACK / NACK is received.
 *    c) If the timer has fired/expired this means that we may have lost COBS synchronisation. At this point
 *	     the TX timer the used for the following purpose
 * 
 * 2) To handle COBS resynchronsiation with a receiver.
 *    When used for this purpose it is controlled as follows:
 *    a) Start the TX timer when an ACK/NACK is not received, and the the timer expires (1c)
 *	  b) Until the timer fires/expires do not send any more packets to the Ultimo from the Host CPU. This allows
 *		 the Ultimo time to reset its' RX buffers, and regain COBS synchronisation
